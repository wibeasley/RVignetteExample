# Goals of this Pacakge
This vignette is a minimal exmaple of an R package that has a nonstandard vignette.  I would like to have a working exmaple of a vignette with these features: 
 1. Uses `knitr` instead of `Sweave` to build the vignette.  
 1. Uses `knitr`'s [code externalization](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/externalization/) feature, where almost all the R code lives in a dedicated *.R file.
 1. Is **not** rebuilt every time the package is checked.  I am pretending this vignette takes a long time to run and compile, and sould be run on CRAN or win-builder computer (or even run on the developer's computer is they don't want to take 5+ minutes)
 1. Saves images to a dedicated directory to make it easier to track changes in GitHub.  Presumably this directory is `./vignettes/FigureRmd`.

I chose and Rmd file instead of a Rnw, so that it could be run on more development boxes, and increase the chance of getting a more helpful & portable response.







## Declare Global Variables

```r
durationInSeconds <- 1.3
```


## Analysis 1

```r
a1 <- RVignetteExample::ComplicatedFunction(durationInSeconds)
print(a1)
```

```
[1] "knjqfhabpy"
```


## Analysis 2

```r
a2 <- RVignetteExample::ComplicatedFunction(durationInSeconds)
print(a2)
```

```
[1] "smilzopqdu"
```


## Graph 1

```r
graphics::plot(x=1:10, y=10:1)
graphics::text(x=1:10, y=1:10, labels=a1)
```

## Graph 2

```r
grid::grid.newpage()
grid::pushViewport(grid::viewport(layout=grid::grid.layout(nrow=1, ncol=1, respect=T)))
grid::grid.rect(gp=grid::gpar(fill="pink", col="tomato")) 
grid::pushViewport(grid::viewport(layout.pos.col=1, layout.pos.row=1)) 
grid::grid.rect(gp=grid::gpar(fill="gray90", col="gray10")) 
grid::grid.text(a2, x=0, y=0, hjust=-.1, vjust=-.2, gp=grid::gpar(cex=1.5, col="blue", lineheight=.8, fill="tan1"), default.units="npc")
grid::popViewport(2)
```
